# Nextjs-starter-GraphQl
a basic template with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and a GraphQL setup using Yoga and Pothos. You can use this template as a starting point for any future GraphQL projects by copying the project and adjusting the graphql schema and resolvers as needed.  Feel free to customize this template further based on your needs!
